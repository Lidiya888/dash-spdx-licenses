IBM Public License Version 1.0
<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
<br/>
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br/>
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>
<p>1. DEFINITIONS
<br/>
"Contribution" means:
</p>
<p>a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original Program, and
</p>
<p>b.  in the case of each Contributor,
<br/>
	i.  changes to the Program, and
<br/>
	ii.  additions to the Program;
<br/>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
<br/>
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br/>
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br/>
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
<br/>
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
<br/>
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
<br/>
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
<br/>
derivative works of the Program.
</p>
<p>"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.
</p>
<p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a
<br/>
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
<br/>
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
</p>
<p>"Original Program" means the original version of the software
<br/>
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source
<br/>
code, object code and documentation, if any.
</p>
<p>"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.
</p>
<p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
<br/>
Agreement, including all Contributors.
</p>
<p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br/>
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br/>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br/>
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
<br/>
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br/>
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
<br/>
object code form.
</p>
<p>b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br/>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br/>
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br/>
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br/>
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
<br/>
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
<br/>
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
<br/>
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
<br/>
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
<br/>
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
<br/>
se is licensed hereunder.
</p>
<p>c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br/>
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br/>
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br/>
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br/>
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br/>
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br/>
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br/>
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
<br/>
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
<br/>
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
<br/>
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
<br/>
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
<br/>
distributing the Program.
</p>
<p>d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br/>
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
<br/>
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS
<br/>
A Contributor may choose to distribute
<br/>
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
<br/>
provided that:
</p>
<p>a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
<br/>
b.  its license agreement:
<br/>
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
<br/>
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
<br/>
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
<br/>
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
<br/>
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
<br/>
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
<br/>
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br/>
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
<br/>
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
<br/>
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such
<br/>
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
<br/>
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
</p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:
<br/>
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and
<br/>
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
<br/>
Program.
</p>
<p>Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:
</p>
<p>	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.
</p>
<p>In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
<br/>
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
<br/>
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
</p>
<p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br/>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
<br/>
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
<br/>
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
<br/>
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
<br/>
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
<br/>
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
<br/>
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
<br/>
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
<br/>
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
<br/>
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
<br/>
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
<br/>
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
<br/>
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
<br/>
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
<br/>
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
<br/>
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
<br/>
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
<br/>
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
<br/>
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
<br/>
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
<br/>
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
<br/>
such claim at its own expense.
</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br/>
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br/>
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br/>
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br/>
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
<br/>
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
<br/>
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
<br/>
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
<br/>
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
<br/>
Contributor must pay those damages.
</p>
<p>5. NO WARRANTY
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
<br/>
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
<br/>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
<br/>
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
<br/>
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
<br/>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
<br/>
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
<br/>
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
<br/>
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
<br/>
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
<br/>
unavailability or interruption of operations.
</p>
<p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
<br/>
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
<br/>
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
<br/>
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
<br/>
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
<br/>
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
<br/>
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
<br/>
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>7. GENERAL
<br/>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br/>
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br/>
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
<br/>
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim
<br/>
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by
<br/>
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall
<br/>
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if
<br/>
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
<br/>
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
<br/>
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
<br/>
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br/>
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br/>
litigation is filed.
</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br/>
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br/>
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br/>
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br/>
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br/>
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br/>
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
<br/>
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
<br/>
and survive.
</p>
<p>IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
<br/>
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
<br/>
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
<br/>
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
<br/>
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
<br/>
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
<br/>
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
<br/>
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
<br/>
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
<br/>
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
<br/>
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
<br/>
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
<br/>
this Agreement are reserved.
</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
<br/>
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
<br/>
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
<br/>
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
<br/>
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>
