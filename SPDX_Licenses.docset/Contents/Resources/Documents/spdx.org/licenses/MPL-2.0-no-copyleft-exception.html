<p>2. License Grants and Conditions
<br/>
--------------------------------
</p>
<p>2.1. Grants
</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
<br/>
non-exclusive license:
</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
<br/>
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
<br/>
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
<br/>
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
<br/>
    as part of a Larger Work; and
</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
<br/>
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
<br/>
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
</p>
<p>2.2. Effective Date
</p>
<p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
<br/>
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
<br/>
distributes such Contribution.
</p>
<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
</p>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
<br/>
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
<br/>
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
<br/>
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
<br/>
Contributor:
</p>
<p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
<br/>
    or
</p>
<p>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
<br/>
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
<br/>
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
<br/>
    Version); or
</p>
<p>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
<br/>
    its Contributions.
</p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
<br/>
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
<br/>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
</p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses
</p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
<br/>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
<br/>
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
<br/>
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
</p>
<p>2.5. Representation
</p>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
<br/>
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
<br/>
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
</p>
<p>2.6. Fair Use
</p>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
<br/>
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
<br/>
equivalents.
</p>
<p>2.7. Conditions
</p>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
<br/>
in Section 2.1.
</p>
<p>3. Responsibilities
<br/>
-------------------
</p>
<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form
</p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
<br/>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
<br/>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
<br/>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
<br/>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
<br/>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
<br/>
Form.
</p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
</p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
</p>
<p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
<br/>
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
<br/>
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
<br/>
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
<br/>
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
</p>
<p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
<br/>
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
<br/>
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
<br/>
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
</p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
</p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
<br/>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
<br/>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
<br/>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
<br/>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
<br/>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
<br/>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
<br/>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
<br/>
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
<br/>
License(s).
</p>
<p>3.4. Notices
</p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
<br/>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
<br/>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
<br/>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
<br/>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
</p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms
</p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
<br/>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
<br/>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
<br/>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
<br/>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
<br/>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
<br/>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
<br/>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
<br/>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
<br/>
jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
<br/>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br/>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br/>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
<br/>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
<br/>
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
<br/>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
<br/>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</p>
<p>5. Termination
<br/>
--------------
</p>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
<br/>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
<br/>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
<br/>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
<br/>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
<br/>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
<br/>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
<br/>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
<br/>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
<br/>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
<br/>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
<br/>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
<br/>
Your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
<br/>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
<br/>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
<br/>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
<br/>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
<br/>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.
</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
<br/>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
<br/>
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *

<br/>

<br/>
*                                                                      *

</p>
<p>8. Litigation
<br/>
-------------
</p>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
<br/>
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
<br/>
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
<br/>
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br/>
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
<br/>
cross-claims or counter-claims.
</p>
<p>9. Miscellaneous
<br/>
----------------
</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br/>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br/>
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
<br/>
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
<br/>
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
</p>
<p>10. Versions of the License
<br/>
---------------------------
</p>
<p>10.1. New Versions
</p>
<p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
<br/>
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
<br/>
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
<br/>
distinguishing version number.
</p>
<p>10.2. Effect of New Versions
</p>

<br/>
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
<br/>
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
<br/>
steward.
</p>
<p>10.3. Modified Versions
</p>
<p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
<br/>
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
<br/>
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
<br/>
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
<br/>
such modified license differs from this License).
</p>
<p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
<br/>
Licenses
</p>
<p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
<br/>
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
<br/>
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
